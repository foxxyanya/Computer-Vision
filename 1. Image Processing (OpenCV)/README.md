# Image Processing with OpenCV
##
### Task
#### Using two images: 
- gray scale image with high resolution

##
- rotated RGB image with lower resolution

##
###### reconstruct RGB image of same resolution which the gray image has.
##
### Used techniques
- key features detection
- matching of the key features
- finding homography based on the features
- pan-sharping techniques
##
### Reconstructed image:
